        Before suggesting a new feature or enhancement for typings, ensure it's related to type annotations or type-related functionalities.
      options:
        - label: I've searched Google & GitHub for similar requests and found none.
          required: true
        - label: I've reviewed the [confluent intro page](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-clients/python/current/overview.html) and [the confluent kafka python docs](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/clients/confluent-kafka-python/html/index.html) and believe this feature is missing from the typings.
          required: true
        - label: I understand that this repository is specifically for type annotations of the Kafka client. If my request is about Kafka client features or functionalities, I need to raise it in the [Confluent Kafka Python repo](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python).
