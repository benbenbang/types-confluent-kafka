# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The collaborators support:
- The most recent minor release with bug fixes
- The latest minor release from the last major version for 6 months after a new major version is released with critical bug fixes
- All versions if a security vulnerability is found provided 1) upgrading to a later version is non-trivial 2) sufficient people are using that version to make support worthwhile
